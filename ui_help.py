        ### 🎙️ Voice Clone

        **Clone any voice from a reference sample**

        #### How it works:
        1. **Select a voice sample** from your samples folder
        2. **Enter text** you want to generate in that voice
        3. **Choose engine**: Qwen3 (Small/Large) or VibeVoice (Small/Large)
        4. **Set language** (Auto-detect recommended)
        5. **Click Generate** - first time processing creates a cached prompt

        #### Model Options:
        - **Qwen3-Small (0.6B)**: Fast, good quality, lower VRAM
        - **Qwen3-Large (1.7B)**: Best quality, higher VRAM
        - **VibeVoice-Small (1.5B)**: Alternative engine, good for long-form
        - **VibeVoice-Large**: Highest quality, most VRAM

        #### Performance Tips:
        - ⚡ **First generation** for a sample takes longer (creates prompt cache)
        - ⚡ **Subsequent generations** use cached prompt and are much faster
        - 🔄 Cache is **per model size** - switching sizes recreates cache
        - 💾 Prompts are saved to `samples/` folder as `.prompt` files

        #### Seed Control:
        - Use **same seed** for reproducible results
        - Set to **-1** for random generation each time

        ### 💬 Conversation Generator

        **Create multi-speaker dialogues with different voices**

        #### Two Engines Available:

        **1. Qwen3-TTS (CustomVoice)** - Fast, premium speakers
        - Uses 9 built-in premium voices
        - Supports style instructions in parentheses
        - Best for short to medium conversations

        **2. VibeVoice** - Long-form, custom voices
        - Use your own voice samples (1-4 speakers)
        - Can generate up to **90 minutes** of audio
        - Best for audiobooks, podcasts, long dialogues

        #### Script Format:
        ```
        [1]: Hello there!
        [2]: Nice to meet you.
        [1]: How are you today?
        ```
        Or use speaker names:
        ```
        Vivian: Hello there!
        Ryan: Nice to meet you.
        ```

        #### Style Instructions (Qwen3 only):
        Add emotions in parentheses:
        ```
        [1]: (excited) This is amazing!
        [2]: (confused) What do you mean?
        ```

        #### VibeVoice Setup:
        1. Select voice samples for Speaker 1-4
        2. Use `[1]:`, `[2]:` etc. in your script
        3. Adjust CFG scale (3.0 recommended)
        4. Generate - can take several minutes for long content

        #### Pause Duration:
        Controls silence between dialogue lines (Qwen3 only)
        - Default: 0.5s
        - Longer pauses: More natural conversations
        - Shorter pauses: Faster pacing

        ### 🎨 Voice Design

        **Create entirely new voices from natural language descriptions**

        #### How it works:
        1. **Enter reference text** - what the voice should say
        2. **Describe the voice** in natural language
        3. **Generate** - creates a unique voice matching your description
        4. **Save to samples** if you like it (to use for cloning)

        #### Voice Description Examples:
        - "A young male with a deep, calm voice"
        - "Elderly woman, warm and gentle tone"
        - "Energetic teenager, slightly high-pitched"
        - "Professional narrator, clear and authoritative"
        - "Friendly female, casual and approachable"

        #### Tips:
        - Be **specific** about age, gender, tone, emotion
        - Mention **voice characteristics**: deep, high, raspy, smooth
        - Add **personality traits**: friendly, serious, energetic, calm
        - Keep descriptions **concise** but descriptive

        #### Design → Clone Workflow:
        1. Create a designed voice you like
        2. Save it as a sample (gives it a name)
        3. Use it in **Voice Clone** tab for longer generations
        4. Share your custom voices with others

        #### Model:
        - Uses **Qwen3-TTS VoiceDesign** (1.7B only)
        - More creative but less predictable than cloning
        - May take several attempts to get desired result

        ### 🏋️ Train Model

        **Train custom voice models on your own voice data**

        #### Training Workflow:
        1. **Select dataset folder**: Choose your prepared dataset (50-100 audio clips recommended)
        2. **Enter speaker name**: Give your trained model a unique name
        3. **Select reference audio**: Pick one sample (5-10 seconds, clear quality)
        4. **Configure parameters**: Adjust training settings (defaults work well)
        5. **Start training**: Click "Start Training" and wait for completion

        #### After Training:
        Your model will be saved in `trained_models/{speaker_name}/`

        **Use it with:**
        Voice Presets tab → Trained Models → Select Speaker Name

        #### Training Parameters:
        - **Model Size**: 1.7B (Large) for best quality, 0.6B (Small) for faster training
        - **Batch Size**: Number of samples per training step (reduce if out of memory)
        - **Learning Rate**: Controls training speed (default: 2e-5 works well)
        - **Epochs**: How many times to train on full dataset (3-5 recommended)

        #### Hardware Requirements:
        - **VRAM**: 8GB+ for Small (0.6B), 16GB+ for Large (1.7B)
        - **Storage**: Several GB for checkpoints and model files

        #### Dataset Requirements:
        - **50-100 samples**: Ideal training size
        - **Consistent quality**: Same recording setup throughout
        - **Accurate transcripts**: Critical for training success
        - **Reference audio**: One high-quality sample (5-10s) for voice characteristics

        #### Monitoring Training:
        - Watch training status in real-time
        - Model checkpoints saved per epoch
        - Later epochs usually perform better
        - Test checkpoints in Voice Presets tab

        #### Best Practices:
        - Start with default parameters
        - Use high-quality reference audio
        - Ensure dataset is well-prepared (Finetune Dataset tab)
        - Don't interrupt training mid-epoch
        - Keep multiple checkpoints for comparison

        #### Troubleshooting:
        - **Out of memory**: Reduce batch size or use smaller model
        - **Poor quality**: Check dataset quality and transcription accuracy
        - **Slow training**: Normal for large datasets, be patient
        - **Model not improving**: May need more epochs or better data
